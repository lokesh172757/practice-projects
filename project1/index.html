                <h2>Misile Man of INDIA</h2>
                <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a great scientist and the 11th President of India. He was born on October
                    15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He played an important role in developing India’s missiles and
                    space technology, which earned him the title "Missile Man of India." He also helped in making India
                    a nuclear power. Later, as President, he became very popular, especially among students, and was
                    known as the "People’s President." Dr. Kalam believed in hard work, honesty, and the power of
                    education. He inspired millions with his simple life and great thoughts. He passed away on July 27,
                    2015, while giving a speech, doing what he loved most—teaching and inspiring young minds.
